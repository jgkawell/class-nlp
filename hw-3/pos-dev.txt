ID-1206	The Wynn hotel was one of the grandest hotels I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. The shopping is truly the best of all the hotels on the strip! The rooms were ample in size and very modern in the decor. It was five star all the way! My husband loved the sports book and said it was the best of all he has been to. He should know he has been coming to Vegas since the '72. The night life there was fantastic. Surrender is now one of my alltime fav clubs to go to. Let me mention the view was incredible from our rooms. The water falls were beautiful too! I LOVE THE WYNN
ID-1098	The Westin in Virginia Beach is by far my favorite hotel, which is why I keep going back. The fluffy white bedspreads and crisp white sheets will make you feel like royalty. The staff is very courteous and respectful, and the room service is prompt and delicious. I had to take pictures of my eggs benedict because it was plated so elegantly!! They offer a lobby bar and restaurant, a Starbucks, and a fitness center, with some bedrooms having fitness equipment in them. There are tons of restaurants and shops only a block away from the hotel! The rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms. The attention to detail is apparent- from the folded toilet paper to the elegant leaf-shaped soap! Everything is fresh, bright and shiny! I wish I could live at the Westin! You too will get the royal treatment here!
ID-1160	Howard Johnson hotels are the best value for your money and your time. The staff there are very helpful and friendly, and the hotel itself is immaculate. Our family really loved the idea of bringing Fido on our vacation with us, and this hotel accommodated that for us. My children absolutely loved this place and everything about it. They were amazed at the sight of an indoor pool, and delighted when I told them they could go swimming. The hotel also had one of the best complimentary breakfast Ive had at a hotel. There was a huge selection of food. The rooms are big and spacious, so we had no problem fitting everyone in comfortably. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to get away, whether that be with or without family. One of the best hotel experiences of my life!
ID-1188	The first time visiting a city you've never been in is scary. Luckily, my friend booked me a place at embassy suites, and it wasn't so sad anymore. It has a great view from the 7th floor and the lights at night are fantastic. It's in walking distance from the North Point mall in Alpharetta, GA and I just about went there everyday. I practically spent all my money going to the mall and eating out everyday, but it was a fabulous time. The hotel itself has a beautiful interior and the one I stayed at had a free breakfast, an indoor pool and a bar. What more can you ask for? The staff at the hotel were very polite and accommodating and it was just a pleasant experience staying here. I would definitely choose this hotel again when I'm nearby and need a place to stay.
ID-1150	The Melia hotel in Atlanta was exceptionally nice. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. They have a nice bar and grill inside the hotel that was very lively. I enjoyed the overall atmosphere and it was walking distance to the Georgia Aquarium and the Coke building. The price was reasonable considering the location. My room rate including a great breakfast buffet. I was with my daughter visiting the Georgia Aquarium and considering I did not have to spend money on a taxi or buy breakfast, I figured I saved at least $50 each day or $100 total. I would stay again.
ID-1272	We love staying at the Hyatt! We have two little kids, so having an extra sitting room makes our time here so much more pleasant. The boys need to sleep earlier than we do, so we have the freedom here of putting them to bed without having to sit around in the dark waiting for them to fall asleep. We've stayed several times, and have yet to have a dirty room.
ID-1084	Recently I traveled to Phenix City, Alabama to visit my brother who is in the army and stationed in Fort Benning, Georgia. The trip was lengthy and by the time I arrived in Phenix City I was absolutely worn out. I decided to check in at the Quality Inn. I ended up staying there for three nights and enjoyed everything about it. They had the absolute best hot continental breakfast that I have ever had at a hotel and my suite was always clean and stocked with fresh blankets and towels. If I had the opportunity, I would definitely stay there again.
ID-1248	My stay at the Rennaissance hotel in Ft. Lauderdale coincided with the wedding of a dear friend. My initial plans for a place to stay fell through and I had to book a room at the Rennaissance after arriving in the area. The booking staff on the phone was very helpful and the rates were great considering I was reserving for a stay that would begin that very night.  I was very happy with the amenities at the hotel. There is a more than ample parking lot. The lobby was fit for an art museum, and the food was scrumptious. The room we stayed in was beautiful and overlooked the pool and a lake. Our bed was very comfortable and we slept like babies.   Overall the service at the Rennaissance was impeccable. The concierge was extremely helpful, polite, and responsive. If I ever need to be in the area again, I'll make this hotel my first choice.
ID-1204	This hotel was fantastic, everything about it was simply amazing. Not only that, but on my first attempt to find the place, my GPS took me to the wrong location (another Hyatt Place) and even THAT location was clean, and had nice attendants who promptly directed me to the other location.  The price and amenities are simply unbeatable. Due to extending my stay, I had to switch hotels, and let me say, this hotel offered twice the value at half the cost. When you enter, the room is split into multiple rooms, the TV is huge and HD, the WiFi is free, and the beds are so comfortable. Downstairs, they have a 24/7 desert bar, you simply walk down, tell them what you want, and they add it to your tab (they don't even ask for your room number, they remember it!). So convenient and amazing. When you show up, they even offer you a personalized tour!  And when you wake up, stop by the breakfast. Their biscuits and gravy are to die for.

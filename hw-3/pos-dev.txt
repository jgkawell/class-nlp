ID-1224	Hampton Inn and Suites in Lakeland Florida was a great place to stay! We stayed for a Dance competition for my daughter who is 12. the staff was great, the rooms were all on the same floor and we even had a free hot breakfast! I loved this hotels location, it was in the middle of a shopping mall and the girls loved to go out there and walk around or go to the movies all while staying at the hotel A+ Location and service!
ID-1152	The W Hotel in San Francisco, is conveniently located close to the Mascone Convention center and a couple blocks from San Francisco's shopping district - Union Square. The very chic and trendy hotel is well furnished, full of amenities like a gym and indoor pool, and the service is top notch. The rooms are very modern and there are several bars located within the building. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and will help guide if the most knowledgeable guest. I had the privilege to spend a weekend here and I won't hesitate to do it again next time I'm in the area. The hotel is also a stone's throw away from the SFMOMA - San Francisco museum of modern art for the art lovers out there.
ID-1100	I had one of my best hotel experiences in this establishment. This hotel is located right on the beach, had plenty of amenities and the people (both guests and employees) were full of energy and really made me feel both welcome and happy.
ID-1122	I stayed at the Red Lion in Anehiem, CA. It was within walking distance of Disneyland, which was great. The interior of the hotel was beautiful. The marble floors in the lobby were goreous. The room was tastefully decorated, with a beautiful bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was clean. The housekeeping was great. I also loved the great HD TV available in the room. I would stay again!
ID-1162	This is a fantastic botique hotel in Portland, Oregon. All the rooms are suites and include a kitchenette. This hotel is great for small families because it allows you ample space and you have the kitchen included where you can prepare some meals in order to save on some food costs while on vacation. The best part is that there are piles of Starbursts candies throughout the hotel available for the taking!
ID-1216	I have no complaints and I’m a picky hotel guest. The room was clean, the sheets were not old, and the bathroom was spotless. Everything worked properly which made for a great experience while getting ready for an interview. The front desk staff was more the helpful. They gave us advice on where to eat, information on the city, and the place I was interviewing at. The continental breakfast had lots of unique options; it went beyond the average spread at a hotel. I’m impressed.

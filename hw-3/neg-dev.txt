ID-1029	We recently stayed at the Country Inn and Suites in Mishawaka, IN. It seemed dark and had a musty smell. The indoor swimming pool had debris in it so we didn't even get to use it. The carpet also had stains. I would highly recommend staying at a different hotel in this area if you are looking for something that feels new and fresh.
ID-0873	When we reserved a reservation at La Quinta Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, we expected a decent nights sleep at a fairly decent price. We have stayed at La Quinta before and were always satisfied. This particular hotel is not what we expected. It is run down and dirty in the rooms. Also the noise level was a constant all night with the parties going on in numerous rooms around ours. I wouldn't recommend this to my enemy!
ID-0817	The hotel has very thin walls and ceiling so you can hear EVERYTHING. You can even hear full conversations word-for-word. Even when we complained to have someone tell the person above us to be quiet, the manager didn't do anything at all. There was a county fair going on with bus fulls of high school kids having a party right outside our door and were shooting off fireworks. However, no one told them to be quiet. All the manager told us was that we could leave (without a refund).
ID-0967	We didn't feel at home at the Crowne Plaza near the Pittsburgh, PA airport from the moment we got there. The room was not clean, we had to scrub the bathtub before we even thought about using it. Airplanes continually roared above our room, which must have been right under a major landing path for the nearby airport. We expected a higher level of service and room amenities than we received. The outdoor pool was not heated, and it was frigid for late-August. The pool area was also not clean. We were glad for the morning to come so that we could leave and be on our way.
ID-0885	How can I not like sleeping in the happiest place on earth? We for one thing I didn't sleep, at all! The room looked great, with a big high bed and fun decor. But at night my husband and I realized the plush bed was just for show, it was very uncomfortable to lay on. The pillows were like the tiny little airline pillows. I needed 3 under my head just to feel comfortable. We were also disappointed that the hot tub was not working. It was a brisk night and a hot tub dip sounded great, but the water was maybe only 80 degrees. The hot tub was really cute, decorated with the little mermaid. Overall for $300 a night I expect a comfortable bed and a working pool area.
ID-0809	We arrived at the hotel about 5 pm. First of all google maps gave us the wrong address. Sent us 10 miles up the road. (not blaming the hotel). Then we went up to our room and the A/C was not working properly. The ac knob was broken and we could not turn it on or off. It took them about 2 hours to get someone up to fix it. Besides that the stay was blah. Nothing major or nothing to get excited about. I requested a partial refund and finally got one only because I am a priority member.
ID-0983	Upon check in at the hotel the front desk person was very rude, and attenitive in the least. The room was dirty, and the jaccuzi was filthy and out dated.
ID-0897	I really wanted to like the Lemon tree Hotel. However- the king size bed was so hard, I didn't get any sleep for two nights (and I was 7 months pregnant at the time!). The futon in the kitchen/living room of our suite wasn't any better. When we told the front desk person, she looked irked.The fan in the bathroom was so loud, that we ended up not turning the light on (light and fan were connected) when we used the toilet or showered. Speaking of lights, they were so oddly placed and the light switches were not near the lights that they operated. The free breakfast was picked over by the time we got there at 8am both days, but they did restock the pastries and the coffee creamer (begrudgingly!), once they saw us standing there (or overheard us talking about going elsewhere).
ID-1011	I stayed at this days inn hotel for 5 days and bill was over $250.00 way to much for this uncomfortable stay. Located near the main street and highway so it was a lot of noise all day and night. Reminded me of an old motel. Smelled musty and molded. No swimming pool!

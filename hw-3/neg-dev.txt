ID-0917	Super 8 was a hotel I recently stayed at due to lack of other options. As far as hotels go, they were untidy, service was slow and the overall experience was horrible. The room I got has bed sheets strewn all over the place, and no room keeping person had bothered to clean the room after the previous person had left. The service was slow and it took an unreasonable amount of time to get a simple makeshift bed brought to our room. Overall, a horrible experience that was a waste of money.
ID-0895	I hate that motel is cheap noisy very load barly change sheets, ppl tent to break into cars and they barly do anything bout it just sucks...
ID-1029	We recently stayed at the Country Inn and Suites in Mishawaka, IN. It seemed dark and had a musty smell. The indoor swimming pool had debris in it so we didn't even get to use it. The carpet also had stains. I would highly recommend staying at a different hotel in this area if you are looking for something that feels new and fresh.
ID-0915	I was hoping to be able to spend my night somewhere nice for my birthday to get away but boy did I make a big mistake! The room was unclean and the beds unmade. When we went to the office to complain they did every little to apologize and made very little effort to fix the situation. Rude and unclean! I do not plan on returning during my next stay.
ID-1007	I recently stayed at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a regular guest at Red Rock Station Casino, their sister property. I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property. I shared my complaints with the reservation agent upon checking out and he did not seem to care. I will never stay at this location again!
ID-0883	My stay at the Jameson Inn in Lafayette, LA was absolutely horrible. The room was dirty and antiquated. The walls must have been paper thin as I heard every other guest in the entire building. Additionally, guests were venturing in at all hours of the night and I was unable to sleep at all due to the noise. The staff was not friendly and refused to address any of my complaints. I would never stay here again.
ID-0941	I stayed at this hotel when I was trekking across Pennsylvania to get to New York City the next day. I was extremely disappointed by my stay here! The staff ignored most of my questions and brushed those questions off of their shoulders like eh, it can wait. I was even more baffled with disgust when I entered my extremely stuffy room to find a TV that did not work, and a very low internet connection that I PAID to connect to! The meal was great though, room service was mediocre at best, and the bed was surprisingly very comfortable. This hotel was by far the worst I've ever stayed at, you can tell that these people were just in it for the money and had no people skills.
ID-0983	Upon check in at the hotel the front desk person was very rude, and attenitive in the least. The room was dirty, and the jaccuzi was filthy and out dated.
ID-1023	I really didn't like how cheap this motel was. It was somewhat shabby and not very nice sometimes to stay in the main building and was somewhat dark. The place didn't offer as much as I really wanted from a motel.

ID-0997	The desk clerk was very nice. However the rooms were not nice, they had baseboards missing off the walls the tub looked nasty, the toilet didnt flush right, we had to go ask for a plunger to get it to flush at one time. The fridge was iced over. The price was high for such bad rooms!
ID-1013	I called weeks in advance to reserve a room, and informed the staff that I had a handicapped woman with me so I would need a wheelchair accessible room. When I arrived to the hotel I was shown to my room, which ended up NOT being handicap accessible. The handicap room was not available so I basically had to deal with what they gave me. On top of that, there were no towels in my room and the continental breakfast ended up only being frozen waffles. I will NOT be staying here again.
ID-0969	Me and my family stayed here during the 4th of July weekend as a family get-together and birthday party. The resort has it's own water park, which is nice, but that's about as far as nice got. Upon arriving, the rooms were not what had been described to the person who purchased all of the rooms, and they had to purchase an additional room to make up for the misunderstanding. Later, one of the rooms was charged to another family member who checked in early. Another family member was charged with room service fees for meals they never ordered or received (watch your credit cards closely!). The rooms were dated and the carpeting was gross. The location of the rooms are literally a drive from the front desk, so if you need anything, it's going to take a while. And the maid service? Non-existent until the morning we were all due to leave. For the price, this place was atrocious, and I would never recommend staying here, even with the water park (the added resort fee pays for that). Save your money.
ID-0809	We arrived at the hotel about 5 pm. First of all google maps gave us the wrong address. Sent us 10 miles up the road. (not blaming the hotel). Then we went up to our room and the A/C was not working properly. The ac knob was broken and we could not turn it on or off. It took them about 2 hours to get someone up to fix it. Besides that the stay was blah. Nothing major or nothing to get excited about. I requested a partial refund and finally got one only because I am a priority member.
ID-0977	This is one of the worst places to stay. The hotel is next to railroad tracks, and the trains were running and blowing the horn day and night. When the train wasn't loud, the traffic on the busy street nearby was. The rooms were dirty and had some empty soda bottles in it. Our room was still not ready two hours after we were told it would be ready. We were so desperate to get in our room to change our clothes for a family reunion that we helped the maid make the bed. Do not stay here.
ID-0873	When we reserved a reservation at La Quinta Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, we expected a decent nights sleep at a fairly decent price. We have stayed at La Quinta before and were always satisfied. This particular hotel is not what we expected. It is run down and dirty in the rooms. Also the noise level was a constant all night with the parties going on in numerous rooms around ours. I wouldn't recommend this to my enemy!
